# HPCombi
High Performance Combinatorics in C++ using vector instructions v1.0.3

HPCombi is a C++17 header-only library using the SSE and AVX instruction sets,
and some equivalents, for very fast manipulation of small combinatorial objects
such as transformations, permutations, and boolean matrices. HPCombi implements
new algorithms and benchmarks them on various compilers and architectures.

HPCombi was initially designed using the SSE and AVX instruction sets, and did
not work on machines without these instructions (such as ARM). From v1
HPCombi supports processors with other instruction sets also, via
[SIMD Everywhere][]. It might be the case that the greatest performance gains
are achieved on processors supporting the SSE and AVX instruction sets, but the
HPCombi benchmarks indicate that there are also still significant gains on
other processors too.
